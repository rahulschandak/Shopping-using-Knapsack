# Optimizing Shopping experience using Knapsack Algorithm

Shopping can be challenging for many people, as they often struggle to stick to their budget or carrying capacity or the nutritional value of the contents they buy. Our algorithm aims to address this issue by providing personalized recommendations on which items to purchase, prioritizing the items of the highest value (weight or nutritional value) according to the user's budget. By following these recommendations, users can maximize the efficiency of their shopping trip, ensuring they purchase the most important items first.

Used the knapsack algorithm with various parameters like weight, nutritional value, etc. to optimize the shopping experience for the user.

Initially, we will cover the solution with a recursive approach and then optimize it with a dynamic programming approach concluding why the latter is better than the two.
